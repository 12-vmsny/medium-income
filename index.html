			<p class="intro">Having a cool or warm indoor space is now a substantial need to avoid health risks. This factor can become a financial burden for low income families. 

			</p>
			<p>
				<a href="https://www.nyc.gov/assets/sustainability/downloads/pdf/publications/EnergyCost.pdf" target="_blank">Data</a> published by NYC Gov in 2016 showed that, out of all five boroughs, the Bronx was the second highest borough with the highest percentage of families below Federal Poverty Level (FPL) affected by energy burden distribution by 25%, Brooklyn being the highest with 32%.
				</p>
				<p> 
					An analysis of the data shows that the medium income of families in the Bronx remain low with a 6.4% amid high energy bills. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Energy burden distribution is expected to worsen due to climate change as time progresses. In New York City, electricity bills are <a href="https://earthjustice.org/press/2023/as-heat-rises-and-electric-bills-soar-gov-hochul-must-protect-nyers-by-passing-ny-heat-act" target="_blank">expected to go up</a> both in 2024 and 2025, enlarging the energy gap for low income households in the city.

						For Stephanie Fox, an organizer for Environmental Justice at the New York City Comptroller's Office, the energy burden situation for low-income residents is made up of several problems.
					</p>

					<p> 
						“One thing is that there is a problem with the age of the housing stock; many times, with older homes,” said Fox. “You will have less efficient buildings with less ability to maintain heat, which will often increase the cost of energy.”
					</p>

					<p>
						A <a href="https://www.aceee.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/aceee-01_energy_burden_-_new_york_city.pdf" target="_blank">report</a> published by the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE), stated that certain ethnic groups like Black, Hispanic and Native Americans have disproportionately higher energy burdens than the median household. 

					</p>

					<p>
						In the Bronx, 56.6% of its <a href="https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/bronxcountynewyork/PST045222" target="_blank">demographic</a> is Hispanic or Latino, while African Americans take up to 44.3% of the population.
